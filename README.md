# Solidity-hacktoberfest-2023
Welcome to the Solidity Hacktoberfest 2023 project! This open-source project is designed to assist blockchain developers by providing a centralized repository for well-designed and useful Solidity smart contracts. By contributing to this project, you can help save time for developers working on blockchain projects by offering ready-made, secure, and efficient smart contracts.

# Project Mission 
We want to create a collection of Solidity smart contracts that tackle common problems, are easy to understand, and follow best practices in blockchain development. Our mission is to help blockchain developers save time by giving them easy access to these smart contracts.

## Technology Stack
* Solidity: Our primary language for writing secure and powerful smart contracts. [Solidity docs](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.21/)
* Hardhat: The tool of choice for Ethereum development, helping us with testing, deploying, and managing our contracts. [Hardhat docs](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/getting-started)
* JavaScript: Used for scripting, testing, and building utilities to support our Solidity contracts.

## :memo: How to contribute?
 * Take a look at the [Contributing.md](https://github.com/jaydippatel83/solidity-hacktoberfest-2023/blob/main/Contributing.md)
 * Go through the repository completely!
 * Take a look at the Existing Issues or create your own Issues!
 * Wait for the Issue to be assigned to you after which you can start working on it.
 * Fork the Repo and create a Branch for any Issue that you are working upon.
 * Create a Pull Request which will be promptly reviewed and suggestions would be added to improve it.
